# Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker

<br>
This is an SVG Logo Maker created for the Monash module 10 challenge! 
<br>

<br>
This application does not launch in a browser and instead uses a console line interface via Node.js <br>
<br>
Dependencies required: <br>
<br>

[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/en) <br>
[Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) <br>
<br>

We also used [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for testing!<br>
<br>

Finally, because the main functionality of the project is using ES6 modules for imports and exports and jest is only compatible with common JS 
imports and exports, the project additionally uses [babel-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest) to handle the import / export conversions. 
There are a couple of extra config files that have being created for use by babel-jest. These are, 'jest.config.cjs' and '.babelrc'.
